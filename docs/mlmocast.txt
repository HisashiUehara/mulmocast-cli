MulmoCast is a multi-modal presentation tool built for the generative AI era.

Traditional tools like PowerPoint and Keynote were designed decades ago for human authors. But today, large language models (LLMs) are the ones creating content—and they need a native environment optimized for them.

MulmoCast is that environment.

It enables AI to automatically generate and deliver rich, multi-modal presentations—slides, videos, podcasts, documents, comics—using our open presentation language: MulmoScript.

MulmoScript is a JSON-based “presentation language” that allows LLMs to describe presentations in a structured, machine-friendly format. It supports a wide range of formats: bullet points, charts, graphs, images, voiceovers, and videos. Like HTML for the web, MulmoScript enables interoperability and ecosystem growth.

MulmoCast can render it into any presentation format, giving end users complete flexibility: they can choose how to experience the content—whether as a slideshow, podcast, video, or document. It even supports multilingual output, tailored for reading or listening.

Here is the market oppurtunity for MumoCast.
- Enterprise communication (training, reporting, client updates)
- Education (lecture generation, flipped classrooms)
- Creator economy (video/podcast automation, multilingual publishing)
