MulmoCast is a multi-modal presentation tool for generative AI era. 

Today's tools like PowerPont and Keynotes were designed decade ago for human authors. But now, large langauges models are the ones creating content--and they need their own native envornment. 

MulmoCast is that environment.  It allows AI to generate and deliver rich, multi-modal presentations, slides, videos, podcasts, documents -- automatically, using our open presentation language: MulmoScript.

MulmoScript is a JSON-based "presentation language" that enables large language models to describe multi-modal presentations in a structured text format.

It allows information to be presented in various formats, including bullet points, graphs, charts, images, voiceovers, and videos.

By introducing this intermediate language, we give users the flexibility to choose how they want to experience the presentationâ€”whether as a slide show, podcast, video, or document. It even supports language customization for reading or listening.
