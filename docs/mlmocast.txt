MulmoCast is a multi-modal presentation platform built for the generative AI era.

Traditional tools like PowerPoint and Keynote were designed decades ago for human authors. But today, large language models (LLMs) are the ones generating content—and they need a native environment optimized for them.

MulmoCast is that environment.

It empowers AI to automatically create and deliver rich, multi-modal presentations—including slides, videos, podcasts, documents, and comics—using our open presentation language: MulmoScript.

MulmoScript is a JSON-based presentation language that lets LLMs describe structured, machine-readable presentations. It supports a wide range of elements: bullet points, charts, graphs, images, voiceovers, and videos. Like HTML did for the web, MulmoScript enables interoperability, customization, and ecosystem growth.

MulmoCast renders this content into any format, giving end users complete flexibility in how they consume it—whether as a slideshow, podcast, video, or document. It even supports multilingual output for both reading and listening.

MulmoCast can be used in many markets, such as follwing:
	•	Enterprise Communication: training, reporting, client updates
	•	Education: lecture generation, flipped classrooms, AI tutors
	•	Creator Economy: video/podcast automation, multilingual publishing, scalable storytelling
