A warm, soft-toned Japanese comic (manga) style illustration with gentle watercolor-like shading and clean black linework. The characters have simple, expressive faces with natural skin tones and minimal shadowing. The setting is everyday life, with people (like parents and children) enjoying sunny weather in parks or applying sunscreen. The overall mood is kind, caring, and family-friendly. Use a muted pastel color palette and soft lighting, similar to illustrations in skincare product advertisements or lifestyle manga. The presenter is a young woman with a dark short hair with glasses.</style>"
