It was created by a team led by Daniel Kokotajlo, who previously worked as a governance researcher at OpenAI. What makes this forecast particularly interesting is that Kokotajlo previously published 'What 2026 Looks Like' in 2021, which many observers note made several accurate predictions about AI development well before systems like ChatGPT existed."
